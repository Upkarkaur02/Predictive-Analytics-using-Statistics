3. Description:
   Input(Dataset used): Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
   - The dataset contains credit card transactions labeled as Fraud (1) and Non-Fraud (0).
   - It is a highly imbalanced dataset, where fraudulent transactions form a very small percentage of the total records.
   - Such imbalance can bias machine learning models, making sampling techniques necessary.
     
  Sampling Techniques used:
  1. Simple Random Sampling
  2. Systematic Sampling
  3. Stratified Sampling
  4. Cluster Sampling
  5. Multistage Sampling

  Best Model: RandomForestClassifier
  
  Best Accuracy: 99.56

3. Input / Output
   Input : Dataset(Credit card Fraud Detection Dataset(CSV file) -> Sampling Techniques -> Machine Learning Models -> Model Parameters -> Accuracy Score
   Output: Balanced Datasets -> Trained Models -> Accuracy Score -> Performance Comparison Table -> Best Result Identification
